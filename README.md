## üöÄ About The Project

Midadium is not just another learning management system. It was built from the ground up to solve the core challenges of modern online education: the lack of personalization and the immense manual effort required to create engaging content.

This project leverages a sophisticated, multi-stage AI engine to transform static video lessons into dynamic, interactive learning experiences. By integrating multiple specialized AI models, Midadium automates content creation, provides intelligent discovery tools, and offers data-driven evaluation assistance, creating a smarter ecosystem for everyone.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Platform Features
- **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication for Students, Teachers, and Admins.
- **Course & Lesson Management:** Full CRUD functionality for courses and lessons, including video and PDF uploads.
- **Student Enrollment & Progress Tracking:** Detailed tracking of lesson completion, quiz scores, and worksheet submissions.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Instant updates for students and teachers using **Socket.IO**.
- **Secure Payment Integration:** Seamless course and package purchasing powered by **Stripe**.

### üß† Intelligent AI Features
Midadium's power comes from its strategic AI integrations:

- **Automated Video-to-Text Pipeline:**
  - Uses **FFmpeg** to extract audio from video lessons.
  - Employs **AssemblyAI**'s Speech-to-Text model to generate highly accurate transcripts, which become the foundation for all subsequent AI features.

- **AI Content Generation (powered by Google Gemini):**
  - **Summaries:** Automatically generates concise summaries and key takeaways for any lesson.
  - **Flashcards:** Creates sets of key terms and definitions.
  - **Quizzes:** Generates interactive multiple-choice quizzes with answers.
  - **Worksheets:** Produces critical-thinking questions and guidelines.

- **AI Discovery & Personalization Engine (RAG Architecture):**
  - **Semantic Course Search:** Allows users to find courses using natural language queries (e.g., "I want to build a mobile app").
  - **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests relevant courses based on a student's enrollment history and interests.
  - **AI-Generated Learning Roadmaps:** Creates structured, multi-phase learning paths to help students achieve their goals using the platform's course catalog.

- **AI Evaluation & Analytics Suite:**
  - **AI-Assisted Submission Rating:** Automatically grades student assignments against lesson content, providing a score and constructive feedback.
  - **AI Course Review Analysis:** Performs sentiment and thematic analysis on all student reviews to provide teachers with actionable insights on strengths and areas for improvement.
