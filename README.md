## üöÄ About The Project

Midadium is not just another learning management system. It was built from the ground up to solve the core challenges of modern online education: the lack of personalization and the immense manual effort required to create engaging content.

This project leverages a sophisticated, multi-stage AI engine to transform static video lessons into dynamic, interactive learning experiences. By integrating multiple specialized AI models, Midadium automates content creation, provides intelligent discovery tools, and offers data-driven evaluation assistance, creating a smarter ecosystem for everyone.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Platform Features
- **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication for Students, Teachers, and Admins.
- **Course & Lesson Management:** Full CRUD functionality for courses and lessons, including video and PDF uploads.
- **Student Enrollment & Progress Tracking:** Detailed tracking of lesson completion, quiz scores, and worksheet submissions.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Instant updates for students and teachers using **Socket.IO**.
- **Secure Payment Integration:** Seamless course and package purchasing powered by **Stripe**.

### üß† Intelligent AI Features
Midadium's power comes from its strategic AI integrations:

- **Automated Video-to-Text Pipeline:**
  - Uses **FFmpeg** to extract audio from video lessons.
  - Employs **AssemblyAI**'s Speech-to-Text model to generate highly accurate transcripts, which become the foundation for all subsequent AI features.

- **AI Content Generation (powered by Google Gemini):**
  - **Summaries:** Automatically generates concise summaries and key takeaways for any lesson.
  - **Flashcards:** Creates sets of key terms and definitions.
  - **Quizzes:** Generates interactive multiple-choice quizzes with answers.
  - **Worksheets:** Produces critical-thinking questions and guidelines.

- **AI Discovery & Personalization Engine (RAG Architecture):**
  - **Semantic Course Search:** Allows users to find courses using natural language queries (e.g., "I want to build a mobile app").
  - **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests relevant courses based on a student's enrollment history and interests.
  - **AI-Generated Learning Roadmaps:** Creates structured, multi-phase learning paths to help students achieve their goals using the platform's course catalog.

- **AI Evaluation & Analytics Suite:**
  - **AI-Assisted Submission Rating:** Automatically grades student assignments against lesson content, providing a score and constructive feedback.
  - **AI Course Review Analysis:** Performs sentiment and thematic analysis on all student reviews to provide teachers with actionable insights on strengths and areas for improvement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later)
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (Ensure it's accessible in your system's PATH)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/midadium.git
    cd midadium
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory by copying the example:
      ```sh
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the `.env` file and add your secret keys and configuration:
      ```env
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
      ASSEMBLY_AI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key
      STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
      # Optional: Add FFMPEG_PATH if it's not in your system's PATH
      # FFMPEG_PATH=/path/to/your/ffmpeg/executable 
      ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend # Or your flutter project folder name
    flutter pub get
    ```
    - Make sure your Flutter code (e.g., in a `lib/config/constants.dart` file) is pointing to your local backend server address (e.g., `const String API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";`).

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).

2.  **Run the Flutter App:**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    - Select your target device (emulator, Chrome, or physical device).
    - Run the app:
      ```sh
      flutter run
      ```
